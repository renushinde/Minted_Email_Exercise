Email clickthrough rates are down - Ideas to reverse the decline?
=> Click through rates measures the percentage of clicks that links in your email receive based on the number of people who open your email. Click through rates show how many subscribers are opening through your email and taking desired action. In case of fewwer click through rates, I would look into following aspects:

1. Having a goal oriented Email:
Writing an email that covers all the essential marketing, and avoiding not so necessary information. For example, having an email that shows the company logo, images that support the brand, and call to action buttons. Motivating email readers by providing deadlines or creating some sort of urgency (for example: last 2 days to grab this deal) could be helpful as well. By removing all the distractions and just focusing on objective of an email, could help to get more click through rates. 

2. Responsive email that supports multiple email clients:
Most readers use their phones to look through an email. Having an email which is responsive and supporting towards multiple email clients like Gmail, Apple i-phone, Outlook. 

3.Email segmentation: 
Segmentation and personalization is prooven to increase the email click through rates. Segmantation provides relevant and personalise offers to subcribers thus increasing the email click throgh rate. Tailoring an email towards customer's needs will get a click to the email. By adding elemnts of personalization, we can get customer's past purchase history, website activity and we can send relevant email to the subscriber. 

4. A/B testing:
Running an A/B tests on Email headline, preview texts, Call to action button, any image that is used will be helpful to see what's working and what's not working.
